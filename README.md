# Decision-Tree-and-Adaboost-for-Classification

Decision tree is one of the models extensively used in classification problems. In ensemble learning, we combine decisions from multiple weak learners to solve a classification problem. In this assignment a decision tree classifier is implemented from scratch and used within AdaBoost algorithm.

Detailed program specifications are described in specification.pdf inside the *Classification* folder.
